    <h2>Importance of Doctypes</h2>
    <p>
      Meaning of Doctype: A doctype or <b>Document type declaration (DTD)</b> is
      an instruction that tells the web browser about the markup language in
      which the current page is written. The Doctype is not an element or tag,
      it lets the browser know about the version of or standard of HTML or any
      other markup language that is being used in the document.
